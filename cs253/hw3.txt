In order to be graded correctly for this homework, there are a few things to keep in mind. We'll be grading your web app by POSTing new blog entries to your form and checking that they appear on your blog's front page. There are a few main issues you need to keep in mind in order for this to work:

    We assume your form to create new blog entries is at a path of '/newpost' from your blog's front page. That is, if your blog's front page is at 'www.myblog.com/blog', then the form is at 'www.myblog.com/blog/newpost'.
    The form method must be POST, not GET.
    The form input boxes must have the names 'subject' and 'content' in order for the grading script to correctly post to them.
    You must enter the full url into the supplied textbox above, including the path to your blog's front page. For example, our example app is running at http://cs253-homework-sean.appspot.com/blog, but if we instead only entered http://udacity-cs253.appspot.com/ then the grading script would not work.
    Don't forget to escape your output!
